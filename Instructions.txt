You can install the required libraries using the following commands:
!pip install mediapipe opencv-python
!pip install numpy

To run the code, save the video file "KneeBend.mp4" and the "code_file.ipynb" in 
the same directory.

The video file is large and thus could not upload it directly. Here is the link for the full video:
